                            <p class="card-text">Whenever you engage with our Service (for example, by visiting the Referreview website or using the mobile app), we automatically receive and store information from your browser, including your IP address, 'cookie' information, and the page you requested, in our server logs. 
                                <br>
                                'Cookies' are identifiers that we transmit to your computer via your browser that allow us to identify your browser and tell us how and when pages on our site are accessed, as well as how many people visit them. You may be able to modify your browser's choices to prevent or limit your computer's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from using our Service's greatest features.
                                <br>
                                When we gather user information (such as the number and frequency of visits to our site), we only use it in aggregate form, not in a way that would personally identify you. This aggregate data, for example, shows us how frequently consumers utilize areas of the Service, allowing us to make the Service appealing to as many customers as possible. We may also share this aggregate information with our partners for them to understand how frequently people use their services and our Service for them to offer you an ideal online experience. We never reveal aggregate information to a partner in a way that would individually identify you.
                            </p>

                            <h5>IS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SAFE?</h5>
                            <p  class="card-text">For your privacy and protection, your account is password-protected. You must safeguard your account and Personal Information from unauthorized access by properly selecting and protecting your password and restricting access to your computer and browser by signing out once you have completed accessing your account.<br>
                    We make every effort to keep your account and any Personal Information private, but we cannot guarantee 100% security. Unauthorized entrance or usage, hardware or software failure, and other reasons can all jeopardize user information security at any time.
                    </p>
                            <h5> UPDATION TO THIS POLICY: </h5>
                            <p  class="card-text">We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. The use of the information we gather today is governed by the Privacy Policy in force at the time the information is utilized. If we modify how we use Personal Information, we will tell you by publishing a notice on our Service or sending you an email. When you use the Service after such changes have been posted, you are bound by any modifications to the Privacy Policy. </p>
                            <h5> HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?  </h5>
                            <p  class="card-text">We only store your data for as long as we need it or are obliged by law. This is dependent on why it was gathered and whether or not we have an ongoing legal basis to do so (such as to fulfill a contract between us, perform a service you requested, meet legal requirements, or for our legitimate interests). When there is no longer a justifiable purpose for us to store your data, we will either delete it or anonymize it so that it cannot be used to identify you. We manage data differently depending on its purpose, however, you can remove or request that we erase your data at any time (see 'Your rights' below).<br>
                            The personal information you supply, including reviews, is stored for as long as you have a Referreview account or as long as we need to serve you with our services. If you choose to deactivate your user account, we will keep a log that includes your name, email address, and the date you deleted your account. The log will be kept for three years. Even if you deactivate your Referreview account, we may preserve some information for which we are obliged by law or have compelling legitimate interests. We may keep some data for longer periods for a variety of reasons, including (but not limited to) security, fraud and platform abuse prevention, compliance with legal or regulatory obligations, and protecting our business interests.
